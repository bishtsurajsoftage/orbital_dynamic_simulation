# orbital_dynamic_simulation

Some home-grown Orbital Dynamics and Mission Design tools written in Python. This is predominantly a learning experience, definitely not supposed to be a competitive production ready library. Just a couple
fun demos and projects as I teach myself some OD concepts.

Utilities built with a mix of existing (and awesome) 'poliastro' and 'astropy' libraries, as well as some home grown methods.

## Setup 

### Python
You just need a valid python 3.5 environment to get rolling. Either install dependencies yourself in existing environment, or use Anaconda.

Anaconda's Python distribution is recommended for getting started. Easiest way to get started is to install and create a new Python 3.5 environment from the included (not minimal) 'py-environment.yml' file
http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html

```
$ conda env create -f py-environment.yml
```
Otherwise, if you don't have Anaconda, a working Python 3.5+ environment and a few ancilary modules is all you need.

## Example
Run example notebook for some samples. Note the use of 'astropy.units' for all calculations.

# Todos
Endless!
* Tests with pytest
* Build a Propegator
* Low thrust approximation with 'poliastro.maneuver' objects
* Higher fidelity low thrust design class and propegator
* Documentation on ancilary functions
* Fix label positions in interplanetary trajectory plot
* Figure out how to do flybys (lol like it just deserves one bullet)
* More spice integration
